# Dart: Silent Failures in Async Functions and JSON Parsing

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications:  unhandled exceptions in asynchronous functions and inadequate error handling when parsing JSON responses from API calls.  The `bug.dart` file showcases code with these issues, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:** The original code lacks specific exception handling, potentially masking critical issues in JSON decoding and API interactions.

**Solution:** The solution refines error handling by:
* Catching specific exceptions (e.g., `FormatException` for JSON parsing)
* Providing more informative error messages
* Implementing more robust API error handling

This example highlights the importance of precise error management in asynchronous Dart programming to ensure application stability and easier debugging.
